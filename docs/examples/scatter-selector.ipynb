    "A set of custom matplotlib widgets that allow you to select points on a scatter plot as use that as input to other interactive plots. There are three variants that differ only in what they pass to their callbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. {obj}`.scatter_selector`: callbacks will receive `index, (x, y)` where `index` is the position of the point in the of the points.\n",

    "3. {obj}`.scatter_selector_index`: callbacks will receive `index`\n",
